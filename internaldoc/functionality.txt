Embed question filter
=====================

This filter allows questions from the question bank to be embedded
anywhere that users can input HTML. This can be used in various ways.
For example, it can be a way to make learning materials more interactive.


Setup
=====

The admin will need to

1. Go to Site administration -> Plugins -> Filters -> Manage filters
  and Enable the Embed questions filter.

2. Go to Site administration -> Plugins -> Filters -> Embed questions,
  and review the default options for embedded questions. No needs to
  be changed, but you may have different preferences for your site.


Before you can embed a question
===============================

Questions can only be embedded from course question banks, and they
can only be embedded if they have and 'idnumber' set, and are in
a cateogry with an 'idnumber'.

At the moment, questions and categories in Moodle do not have
idnumbers (until MDL-62708 has been completed), so instead you
need to add '[ID:idnumber-goes-here]' to the question/category name.
In what follows we will assume you have done this, so you have
a category called 'Embeddable questions [ID:embeddable]' that
contains a question called 'Test question [ID:test]' in the course
with id 2.


How to embed a question
=======================

There will evenutally be an Atto editor plugin to help with this.
Until then, only users with capability moodle/question:useall
(to embed any question) or moodle/question:usemine (to
embed questions they created) can generate the necessary embed
codes using the helper script.

1. To generate the code, you have to use the script
   .../filter/embedquestion/testhelper.php?courseid=NNN
   in your Moodle site. (E.g. NNN = 2 for the example above.)

2. Select a question category (e.g. 'Embeddable questions [ID:embeddable]').

3. Enter a question idnumber (e.g. 'test').

4. All the other options can be left as default, or changed as you wish.
   Note that it is only possible to select question behaviours that
   allow the question to finish without the equivalent of the
   whole quiz attempt being submitted.

5. Click the Generate information button.

6. You will see a preview of the embedded questions, which can be used to
   check it is working the way you want. If not you can change the options
   and regenerate.

7. Once you are happy, copy the '{Q{...}Q}' bit from where it says
   'Code to embed the question:'. This can be pasted into any HTML editor
   in the same Moodle course, for example into a page resource or a forum post.

You will notice that the embed code ends with a 40-character hex string.
This (along with the requirement for questions and categories to have
idnumbers) is how we prevent unauthorised users from being able to guess
the embed code for a question that they should not be allowed to see.


Interacting with an embedded question
=====================================

When a user encounters an embedded question, the question will
just appear inline in the page.

Technically the question is embedded in an iframe, but this
should be invisible to users. The iframe should be automatically
sized to just fit the question.

The question should work exactly as it would in a quiz
attempt, if the quiz was set up with the same
options that were used when embedding the question.

After the question has finished, there will be a Start again
button to restart the question. If the question has variants,
and the variant number is not being fixed, then a different
variant will be chosen when the question is restarted.


Miscellaneous points
====================

* Question attempts are stored in the database, but not
  permanently. There is a scheduled task 'Clean up old
  embedded question attempts' which runs once-per-hour
  (by default) to do the necessary clean-up. Attempts are
  removed after 24 hours.

* If you leave a page and come back, the question will
  start again from the beginning.

* Hence, this plugin stores no personally identifiable information,
  and implements the Moodle privacy API to document this.

* Guests are never allowed to interact with embedded questions.

* All interactions with a question (Start, View, Submit) are logged.

* If there are images in the question text, feedback, etc.,
  they will show up just fine.

* If you want to embed questions on site-wide page, they
  need to go in the 'Front page' area of the question bank.

* A a course is backed-up and restored (e.g. roll-forwards)
  the embedded questions should work in the new course.
